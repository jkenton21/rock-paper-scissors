# rock-paper-scissors

The purpose of this project is to create a basic rock paper scissors game using JavaScript
The game for this project is simply made to be played in the console and not with a graphical interface yet.

//revision
We are adding a web browser interface for the project.
Therefore, the HTML will be redone and a CSS file will be created to style the page.
The JavaScript file will be redone as well and include DOM manipulation.
